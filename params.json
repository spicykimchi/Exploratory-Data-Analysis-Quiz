Different plotting systems have different sets of functions for annotating plots in this way. Which of the following functions can be used to annotate the panels in a multi-panel lattice plot?\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\nllines() \r\n\r\nExplanation: http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/lattice/llines\r\n\r\nQuestion 4\r\nThe following code does NOT result in a plot appearing on the screen device.\r\nlibrary(lattice)\r\nlibrary(datasets)\r\ndata(airquality)\r\np <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month), data = airquality)\r\nWhich of the following is an explanation for why no plot appears?\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\nThe object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method.\r\n\r\nQuestion 5\r\nIn the lattice system, which of the following functions can be used to finely control the appearance of all lattice plots?\r\nAnswer\r\ntrellis.par.set()\r\n\r\nQuestion 6\r\nWhat is ggplot2 an implementation of?\r\nAnswer\r\nthe Grammar of Graphics developed by Leland Wilkinson\r\n\r\nQuestion 7\r\nLoad the `airquality' dataset form the datasets package in R.\r\nlibrary(datasets)\r\ndata(airquality)\r\nI am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. What would be the appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2?\r\nAnswer\r\nairquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))\r\nqplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)\r\n\r\nQuestion 8\r\nWhat is a geom in the ggplot2 system?\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\na plotting object like point, line, or other shape\r\n\r\nQuestion 9\r\nWhen I run the following code I get an error:\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\ng <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))\r\nprint(g)\r\nI was expecting a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' to appear. What's the problem?\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\nggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot.\r\nExplanation\r\n> library(ggplot2)\r\n> g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))\r\n> print(g)\r\nError: No layers in plot\r\n\r\nQuestion 10\r\nThe following code creates a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' from the movies dataset in the ggplot2 package. After loading the ggplot2 package with the library() function, I can run\r\nqplot(votes, rating, data = movies)\r\nHow can I modify the the code above to add a smoother to the scatterplot?\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\nqplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + geom_smooth()\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
